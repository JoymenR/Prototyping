# Prototyping
In this project we have to create a prototype of a community portal similar to LinkedIn.  Users of the portal can search for Jobs as well as other users using various parameters such as First Name, Last Name, Company Name, City &amp; Country. 

# Project Backround
We have to develop the prototype of the following pages and functionalities of the portal for ABC Jobs.
1. Community Portal Home Page where the main content should be there
2. Registration Page where new users will be able to join the portal.
3. Registration Confirmation Email will be sent to the user who successfully submit the form.
4. Registration Confirmation Page for the user which successfully complete registration.
5. Update Profile Page for adding more details about the user.
6. Search Users Page which will list all the users based on the search.
7. Public Profile Page will be the page which will be used to display basic information about the selected user.
8. Login Page in which registered users can login using their username and password.
9. Forget Password Page for password recovery for those users which have forgotten their passwords.
10. Design the Forget Password Confirmation Page which will be displayed once the password is changed successfully.
